\arguments{
\item{x}{scene (object of class "scenesetr_scene")
or recording (object of class "scenesetr_recording")}

\item{gif_file}{output gif file}

\item{width}{gif width in pixels}

\item{height}{gif height in pixel}

\item{delay}{time to show each image in seconds}

\item{loop}{if the gif should be repeated. Set to FALSE to only play
once, or a number to indicate how many times to repeat after the first.}

\item{progress}{print some verbose status output}
}
\value{
Object of class "scenesetr_recording", invisibly. List of three elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{initial_scene}: the original scene passed to \code{record()},
\item \code{final_scene}: the scene as it was in the last frame before quitting the device,
\item \code{key_inputs}: a list of key inputs, with one element per frame recorded.
}
}
\description{
Save a recording to GIF or record a scene to GIF.
}
\details{
Creates a temporary directory to store PNG files of each frame, which are
then converted to GIF by \code{\link[gifski:gifski]{gifski::gifski()}}. Frames are run using \code{\link[=record]{record()}}
with \code{save_to_png = TRUE}.

All arguments except for \code{x} are passed to \code{gifski()}.
